# YakTrack

## What is YakTrack?

YakTrack is an open source php based web application for time tracking and productivity management built on the Laravel framework.

## Who is it for?

YakTrack is built for freelancers (especially developers) who may find themselves working in multiple contexts each with their own requirements for time tracking and reporting, project management and so on. YakTrack is designed to be extensible and flexible enough to fit between and interface with these different contexts, simplifying the workflow for the user, and hopefully reducing their mental load. Of course any person or team is welcome to download and use YakTrack, extend it or fork it.

## Project Status

YakTrack is currently in a development state. Things may break and change.

## Concepts

### Session

A session is the core building block of Yak. It represents a block of work for one person. A session time has a start time and a finish time.
